You will usually see me carrying my Sony ILCE-7M3 + Sony 24-70 mm f/2.8 GM II (I promise the Sony version is 1000x better than the Sigma and Tamron version 🗿) with me. 😀 I usually shoot landscapes and architecture but love to try out new things and I'm currently experimenting with light painting/long exposures, sports photography, portraits, night photography, and more. If you have a passion in photography too, I would love to have some photo walks together! 🤩 If you're interested, feel free to reach out : D . Or if you just want to connect or chat, that would be great too : ) .Fun fact: I currently have an internship with the athletics department so you might see some photos I took of some of the teams during practices and competitions posted on their IG accounts 📸 Special thanks to Iven for the photos! 😎 It was a pleasure to have met a lot of you during convocation, had a lot of fun! 😁 祝大家一個順利的學期，身體健康，早日脫單！ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ",
